 		<h1>Queerness and Disney</h1>
 		<p>The Disney Renaissance is a time period in cinematic history that many look back to fondly, a large part being because of its music. The Little Mermaid (1989), is a film recognized as the beginning of this era. Its music was composed by Howard Ashman, a gay man who died of AIDs at 40 years old. His music is an integral part to Disney's most adored films, such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. But the scope of queerness extends far beyond lyrics. From character designs, stories, and other key agents in making these iconic films, the representation of queerness has always been present, although not all were positive.</p>
