		<h2>Sesame Street’s production across the world</h2>
		<p>Since its debut in 1969, Sesame Street’s educational influence has reached worldwide status. Through multiple co-productions of the Sesame Street Workshop and education professionals from across the world, a variety of versions of the show have been made with the intended purpose of suiting a country’s values and traditions. Because of this, many places have their own separate versions of characters, such as Abelardo, Latin America’s version of Big Bird from Plaza Sesamo. Iconic characters such as Elmo are kept throughout productions, although some have names changed to better suit their country, such as Bert and Ernie, whose names are Vlas and Enik in Ulitsa Sezam.</p>
		<h2>The production behind Pixar’s Toy Story and its Influence on the Incredibles.</h2>
		<p>Knick Knack was the first taste of what Toy Story could be, a 3D animated short that was released in 1989. Until Toy Story's release in 1995, 3D animation had been used for snippets in 2D films, and the choice to keep its story revolving around toys had to do with the program's limited features to properly animate humans.
		When the Incredibles came out nearly a decade later, animation on humans had improved, but it was still a hassle. Unmoved by this, director Brad Bird had animated not just humans but multiple animated shots that included fire, water, and other exasperating elements to work in animation.</p>
		<h2>Queer History within Disney</h2>
		<p>The Disney Renaissance is a time period in cinematic history that many look back to fondly, a large part being because of its music. The Little Mermaid (1989), is a film recognized as the beginning of this era. Its music was composed by Howard Ashman, a gay man who died of AIDs at 40 years old. His music is an integral part to Disney's most adored films, such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. But the scope of queerness extends far beyond lyrics. From character designs, stories, and other key agents in making these iconic films, the representation of queerness has always been present, although not all were positive.</p>
